# Share Later
An Android app that enables sharing content in a deferred way.

- Want to share an interesting article that you're reading while on a plane without network connectivity? Got you covered.
- Send a snippet of text to your colleague but don't want to disturb her out of working hours? No problem.
... More use cases to follow, but hey at least there're two of the problems I reguarly encounter


## Supported content types

In the first version the app is only supporting text-based sharing (text/plain).
Further content types such as images / videos are also a possibility based on need.


## Usage

Things are still shaping, but the core idea is the following:

1. After installing the app, an extra sharing option - Share Later - will appear on the sharing menu for supported content types.

2. By selecting this method of sharing you may select the criteria by which you'd like to defer sharing and also the application that you'd use to share your content later.

3. When the deferred sharing criteria is met, you receive a notification about it. By clicking on the notification, you trigger the sharing action you've previously set up.


## Downloads

Hold tight for a Play Store release + .apk download at this site. Development is still commencing.
